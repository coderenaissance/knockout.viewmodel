                <h3>Updating a viewmodel</h3>

                <p>If you need to update your viewmodel with more recent model data this can be done by calling updateFromModel.</p>

                <pre><code>

				<p>This method optionally takes a third parameter, makeNoncontiguousObjectUpdates, which can be used to eliminate long running script errors in older browsers. When set to true  each object will have an update function created for it which will be called via setTimeout. Given this makeNoncontiguousObjectUpdates should only be set to true if you are getting long running script errors in older browsers. An onComplete method allows you to pass in a callback to be fired when noncontiguous object updates are completed.</p>
				<pre><code>
ko.viewmodel.updateFromModel(viewmodel, updatedModel, true).onComplete(function(){
    //respond to completion of update
});

                <h3>Processing Option Paths</h3>

                <p>Processing options are specified for an item by it's path. Every full path starts with {root}. Items in an array are referred to as [i]. So a path of "{root}.users[i].firstName" would be used to specify custom processing for the firstName property of every object in the users array. That is its full path name, but it's not necessary to refer to every item by it's -full path name. There are three ways of referencing a path:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Full Path Name - Matches only the specific path, e.g. "{root}.users[i].firstName".</li>
                    <li>Parent Child-Name - Matches the parent child combination specified. So "users[i].firstName" will only match the first name property on objects in the users array. Array items have to be referenced as ParentName[i].ChildName but for all other objects the proper reference is ParentName.ChildName</li>
                    <li>Property Name - Matches every property with that name. So a partial path of "firstName" would match every firstName property in your model.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="processingTypes" class="inner">
                <h3>Processing Options</h3>

                <p>
                    There six types of processing options: custom, append, exclude, extend, arrayChildId, and shared.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>custom - the path and all of it's children are processed only as you specify</li>
                    <li>append - the path and it's children are appended as is </li>
                    <li>exclude - the path is excluded from processing</li>
                    <li>extend - the path and it's children are processed normally but then extended/modified as specified</li>
                    <li>arrayChildId - used to identify the what property of the array's child objects should to identify them for update purposes</li>
                    <li>shared - allows you to reduce duplicate definitions by creating named processing functions that can be used with extend and map.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The only processing types that can be used together on a path are extend and arrayChildId. If multiple processing options are specified 
                    for the same path only one will win. Which one will win is subject to internal processing logic that has been organized for performance reasons
                    and should not be relied upon as it is subject to change in future versions.
                </p>
                <section id="extendOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>extend - processing option</h4>
                    With the extend processing option the path and it's children are processed normally but then extended/modified as specified.
                <pre><code>
options:{ 
    extend:{
        "{root}.users[i]": function(user){
            user.isDeleted = ko.observable(false);
            return user;
        }
    }
};
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            The value of the path is passed to the extend function after processing has been completed on the path and its children. Objects can be modified without being returned. 
            Note: Whatever is returned from the extend function will be persisted and replace the default processing.
        </p>
        There is also this alternate syntax if you need to do unmapping:
        <pre><code>
options:{ 
    extend:{
        "{root}.users[i]": {
            map:function(mapped){
                mapped.isDeleted= ko.observable(false);
                return mapped;
            },
            unmap:function(unmapped){
            //Because isDeleted was an observable it was unwrapped and added to the model. 
                delete unmapped.isDeleted;
                return unmapped;
            }
        }
    }
};
                    </code></pre>
                    Functions added with extend will be removed when your model is created, however observables will not be and can be removed using unmap if they will cause 
                    problems with servers side serialization. It should be noted that in many cases serialization will drop unexpected properties instead of throwing an 
                    error, so this is not always necessary and would depend on your platform.
                </section>
                <section id="customOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>custom - processing option</h4>
                    The custom processing gives you complete control over mapping and unmapping from model to viewmodel and back, though as in the example below you can
                    make additional calls to viewmodel to make things simpler. One case this is often used for is in translating back and forth from a server format (think date values) or structure
                    to a format or structure that is easier to work with in javascript.
        <pre><code>
options:{ 
    custom:{
        "{root}.users[i]": function(user){
            user.isDeleted= ko.observable(false);
            return user;
        }
    }
};
         </code></pre>

            There is also this alternate syntax if you need to do unmapping
        <pre><code>
options:{ 
    custom:{
        "{root}.users[i]": {
            map:function(user){
                var mapped = ko.viewmodel.fromModel(user);
                mapped().isDeleted= ko.observable(false);
                return mapped;
            },
            unmap:function(user){
                var unmapped = ko.viewmodel.toModel(user);
                delete unmapped.isDeleted;
                return unmapped;
            }
        }
    }
};
        </code></pre>
                    In this case the users are passed through as is with the addition of an observable isDeleted flag.
                <br />
                    Note: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure to return something from your function, otherwise undefined will be returned as the result of custom.</li>
                    <li>The object passed into map is the unaltered object from your viewmodel or model (depending on if you are calling fromModel or toModel).</li>
                </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="appendOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>append - processing option</h4>
                    With the append processing option the path and all of it's children are appended as is.
        <pre><code>
options:{ 
    append:["{root}.users[i]"]
};
        </code></pre>
                    In this case none of the users have been altered and are appended unchanged.
                </section>
                <section id="excludeOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>exclude - processing option</h4>
                    With the exclude processing option the path and it's children are excluded from processing and will not be included.
                    <pre><code>
options:{ 
    exclude:["{root}.users[i].firstName"]
};
                </code></pre>
                    The firstName property is not included.

                When calling fromModel:
                <ul>
                    <li>the path specified will not be wrapped in an observable.</li>
                </ul>
                    When calling toModel:
                <ul>
                    <li>if the path is for a computed value it will be unwrapped.</li>
                    <li>if the path is for a non-observable value it will be included.</li>
                </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="idOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>arrayChildId - processing option</h4>
                    The arrayChildId option allows you to flag what the id is on an object within an array of objects so that those objects can be updated and not replaced when updateFromModel is called. 
                    If an arrayChildId is not specified then when updated data is loaded all old items will be removed from the array and new items added, which will 
                    cause you to loose the state of those objects. The syntax for this is simple:
                <pre><code>
options:{ 
    arrayChildId:{
        "{root}.users":"id"
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                But this will make more sense in context. What if you had an array of items for purchase and the selected items were added to your total. 
                The code might look similar to this:

                <pre><code>
var model = {
    items:[
        {
            id:256889,
            name:"item Name",
            description:"Description of Item",
            availble:3,
            price:4.25
        }
    ]
};

var viewmodel = ko.viewmodel(model, { 
    arrayChildId:{//child item id
        "{root}.items":"id"
    },
    extend:{
        "{root}.items":function(items){//Toggle function added to array for better performance
            items.ToggleSelect = function (item){
                item.selected(!item.selected);
            }
            return items;
        },
        "{root}.items[i]":function (item){
            item.selected = ko.observable(false);
        }
    }
}
                </code></pre>
            So now imagine the app is regularly pinging the server to for an updated model so that the number of items available is accurate. 
            Without the arrayChildId option every time an update came back the array would be populated again and all of the items would be 
            extended with selected set to false. With the arrayChildId specified selected state of all objects will be maintained.
            </section>
                <section id="sharedOption" class="inner">
                    <h4>shared - processing option</h4>
                    This option allows you to define processing functions that can be reference by name in the extend and custom processing options, 
                    thus eliminating duplicate code. The following example shows a model for a movies with showtimes. The options extend both 
                    the movies and the showtimes with an observable property called selected.
                <pre><code>
var model = {
    movies:[
        {
            id:256889,
            name:"item Name",
            description:"Description of Item",
            showtimes:[
                {start:"11:45am", duration:"120 minutes", soldOut:false, pricingType:"Matinee"},
                {start:"6:45pm", duration:"120 minutes", soldOut:false, pricingType:"Evening"}
            ]
        }
    ]
};

var options = { 
    arrayChildId:{//child item id
        "{root}.movies":"id"
    },
    extend:{
        "{root}.movies[i]":"ExtendWithSelectable",//Reference shared function by name
        "{root}.movies[i].showtimes[i]": function(showtime){

            //Reference shared function directly
            options.shared.ExtendWithSelectable(showtime);

            showtime.price = ko.computed(function(){
                if(showtime.pricingType = "Matinee"){
                    return 6.75;
                }
                else if(showtime.pricingType = "Evening"){
                    return 10.25;
                }
            };
        }
    },
    shared:{
        ExtendWithSelectable:function (item){
            item.selected = ko.observable(false);
            return item;
        }
    }
}

var viewmodel = ko.viewmodel(model, options);
                </code></pre>

                Another common use of this functionality would be if you had date, currency, or other formatting that needed to be applied to a large number of item. Or
                perhaps for a large number of fields you wanted "N/A" to be displayed if their were no values. This functionality could be defined once in shared
                and reference in many places by name.
